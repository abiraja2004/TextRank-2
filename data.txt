The definition of manufacturing process is exhaustive. Under the present definition even transporting, washing,
cleaning, oiling and packing which do not involve any transformation as such which is necessary to constitute
manufacturing process in its generic sense, are nonetheless treated as manufacturing process. The definition is
artificially projected beyond the scope of natural meaning of what the words might convey thus covering very
vide range of activities. Madras High Court in the case of In re. Seshadrinatha Sarma, 1966 (2) LLJ 235, held
that to constitute a manufacture there should not be essentially some kind of transformation of substance and
the article need not become commercially as another and different article from that at which it begins its existence
so long as there has been an indisputable transformation of substance by the use of machinery and transformed
substance is commercially marketable.Division Bench of A.P. High Court held that to determine where certain premises is factory, it is necessary that it should carry on manufacturing process and it does not require that the process should end in a substance being manufactured (Alkali Metals (P) Ltd. v. ESI Corpn., 1976 Lab.I.C.186). In another case it was observed that manufacturing process merely refers to particular business carried on and does not necessarily refer to the
production of some article. The works of laundry and carpet beating were held to involve manufacturing process.
A process employed for purpose of pumping water is manufacturing process. Each of the words in the definition
has got independent meaning which itself constitutes manufacturing process.
